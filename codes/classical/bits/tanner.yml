description: 'Let G be a \(n \times m\) bipartite graph which is d-right regular and let \(C_0 \subseteq \mathbb{F}_2^q\) be a binary linear code. The Tanner code \(X(G,C_0)\) is defined as the set \(\{c\in \mathbb{F}_2^{n}| \all u \in R_G, c_{|N(u)}\in C_0\}\). The Tanner codes are a generalization of expander codes, with \(C_0\) chosen to be \([d,d-1,2]_2\) parity check code. Since \(C_0\) imposes t constraints on its codewords, there are at most Mt constraints, where M is the size of the right set R. Hence dim of codewords is \(\geq N-Mt\).'

# This field starts a list of specific labeled subfields; do not leave it
# empty. If empty, comment out. Also, indentations are important!
features:

  # The fields below relate to specific properties of the code that are worth
  # noting. In some cases (see below), there might be multiple pieces of
  # information associated with a field (e.g., mutliple encoders/decoders,
  # multiple facts about fault tolerance, etc.); in such cases, the field
  # accepts a list of text entries, with one item per piece of information.
  #
  # Any fields below should be omitted if they do not apply.

  rate: 'For \(C_0\) with rate R, the Tanner code has rate at least 2R-1. For \(C_0\) satisfying Gilbert-Varshamov bound, the rate vs relative distance for the Tanner code is given by \(R \geq 2(1- h(\delta_0))\), where \(\delta_0\) is the relative distance of \(C_0\).'
